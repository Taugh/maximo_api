## MVP Requirements for Maximo API Project

- Users can view a list of advanced, premade work order reports.
- Users can select a report and enter required parameters (via web or SharePoint interface).
- The system runs the report securely against the Maximo database and returns the results.
- Users can view or download the results in a user-friendly format (table, CSV, Excel).

## User Stories

1. **As a maintenance planner,** I want to run an advanced work order report by entering specific parameters, so I can get insights not available in standard Maximo reports.

2. **As a supervisor,** I want to download the results of a custom report, so I can analyze and share them with my team.

3. **As an authorized user,** I want to access these reports without needing direct database or SQL knowledge, so I can get the data I need easily and securely.

4. **As a report administrator,** I want to manage which advanced reports are available to users, so only approved queries are accessible.

5. **As a user,** I want to see clear error messages if my input is invalid or if the report fails, so I know how to correct the problem.

These requirements and user stories will guide the design and development of your MVP. You can expand or refine them as the project evolves.
